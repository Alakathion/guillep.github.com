!About me

Coding enthusiast. Mad hatter. Software engineer and researcher. 

Right now I work as a research engineer at Inria, at the RMoD team, to put into production the Pharo bootstrap and a new database driver solution.

I obtained the 13 of april 2015 my Phd entitled "Virtualization support for application runtime specialization and extension" under the direction of Stéphane Ducasse (*Inria Rmod team>http://rmod.lille.inria.fr*) and the supervision of Noury Bouraqadi and Luc Fabresse(*CAR team>http://car.mines-douai.fr/* of Mines Douai).

My main topics of interests are the runtime adaptation of applications, Virtual Machine design and development, and programming language tools.
In particular, I mostly use the object oriented language *Pharo>http://www.pharo-project.org*, because of it's reflective and dynamic capabilities.

I love coding.
I spend a lot of my free time helping the amazing community of *Pharo>http://www.pharo-project.org*. I also participate in several projects such as the Pharo's database driver suite (*DBXTalk>http://dbxtalk.smallworks.com.ar*), it's shortcut framework, or the static web page generator Ecstatic.
