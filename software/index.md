###Oz Object Spaces

This is my main software contribution from my phd. Oz object spaces allow the complete manipulation of an object runtime from another object runtime: debugging, browsing, object graph analysis, etc. My implementation is based on [Pharo](http://www.pharo-project.org) and contains two main elements:

- Oz Virtual Machine: is a Pharo Stack virtual machine with support for handling several worlds at the same time.
- Oz Language side Packages: are the packages that at the language level allow the manipulation of other object runtimes.
