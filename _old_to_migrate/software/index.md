###Ozono

Ozono is simplified development environment built on top of [Pharo](http://www.pharo-project.org) to teach OOP. Its core idea is to focus on the main ideas behind the object paradigm: object, message and polymorphism. As a consequence, other ideas such as the way to organize the behavior of objects (e.g. with classes or traits or mixins) is delayed and treated as a secondary concept.

The current implementation has its UI in spanish. There are some ongoing efforts to provide translations to english and french.
